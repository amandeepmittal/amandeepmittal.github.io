Is it a valid JavaScript Object?\\nYes, virtual DOM is a JavaScript object which initially is just the copy of the real DOM.

When a component is \\u201Cstateless\\u201D, it never mutates the state. With the same inputs, it will always produce the same output.

Do all React components have to act like pure functions with respect to their props?\\nA pure function is a function that doesn\\u2019t depend on and doesn\\u2019t modify the states of variables out of its scope.
